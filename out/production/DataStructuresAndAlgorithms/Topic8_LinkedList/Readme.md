# Double Linked List

1. it is a Linear DATA Structure

2. it is also collection of adjacent structures or Node or List

3. Here , we consists of previos field , Data field , Next Field.


# Fields in Node

1. Data Field :

Data field used for storing address of next list

2. Next Field :

it is used for stooring the address of  next field

3. previos field

it is used for stooring the address of  previous field
