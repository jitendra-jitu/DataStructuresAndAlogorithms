# What is a Circular Linked List?

1. A circular linked list is a special type of linked list where all the nodes are connected to form a circle.
2. Unlike a regular linked list, which ends with a node pointing to NULL, the last node in a circular linked list points back to the first node.
3. This means that you can keep traversing the list without ever reaching a NULL value.

# Types of Circular Linked Lists

We can create a circular linked list from both singly linked lists and doubly linked lists. So, circular linked list are basically of two types:

1. Circular Singly Linked List
2. Circular Doubly Linked List:



i=0
2
i=1
3
